#Quality++  |  Shiny Mechanics

An expansion to the quality system that adds extremely rare, powerful, intermittent qualities to the game. Shiny qualities contain unique abilities. Does not require Quality++ | Extended Qualities to function.

It currently adds a variant to each of the qualities included in factorio, with the exception of normal.
If you have the Quality++  |  Extended Qualities mod installed, it adds shiny variants of those qualities to the game as well.
Each of these qualities has a 1/1000 chance of occurring during an upgrade event. This is intended to feel similar to shiny hunting in games similar to Pok√©mon.

The goal of this mod is to offer you even more way to play around with the quality system.

##Settings

***Eventually there will be settings for you to adjust to your liking.***

If you enable/disable qualities included in the other Quality++ mods, the shiny qualities will dynamically stitch together the proper quality chain.
If you have Customizable Quality Names installed, the quality names will be added, appended with the ": Shiny" string.

More options will become available as the mod expands and/or compatibility widens.

##Bug Reporting
***Please report any issues you encounter on the discussions page.***

##Modded Content and Strategy
The ***only*** way to acquire shiny variants of machines is to use ingredients directly below the desired quality, and to build the machine directly.
E.g. use Epic ingredients if you were fishing for Legendary: Shiny quality.
Intermediate and raw materials that are of the Shiny variant are useless. 
This is due to the added qualities being marked as hidden (intended).

Reference the pictures above to get an idea of what this means for you.

As it stands, the shiny variants of the qualities are all intended to have a unique, powerful attribute, as well as being assigned a level of 21.
***Most of these attributes will do nothing until the next release of Factorio***

The unique attributes are as follows:

    All Shiny Qualities:
       Level: 21
