Version: 0.0.4
Date: 18JUL25
  Changes:
    - Changed the probability for a shiny event to occur to 511/512.
    - The math behind this assumes a 12.4% quality. Out of 4096 total different crafts, at this quality --
    - approx 512 of them will have an upgraded quality. We want exactly one of these (on average) to be shiny.
    - In total, the math has been changed to be a chance to happen in all quality crafts vs. on upgrade events.
    - The total effect is that there should be many more shinies, but not too terribly many.

Version: 0.0.3
Date: 12JUL25
  Changes:
    - Executed another balance pass.
    - Changed all Standard Shiny qualities: science_pack_drain_multiplier 95 -> 93 (a very slight buff).
    - Changed all Quality++ Shiny qualities to have their level be reflective from the balance pass on 12JUN25 (eventually this will be dynamic).
    - --- All Shiny qualities' levels have been adjusted to be 12 (Artifactual's level was adjusted to be 10).
    - --- All Shiny qualities' science_pack_drain_multiplier has been set to 88/100 (Buff in some cases, nerf in others).
    - Code cleanup.

Version: 0.0.2
Date: 11JUL25
  Changes:
    - Executed a balance pass.
    - Changed all Standard Shiny qualities up to and including Legendary: Shiny to have its level set to 7 (from 21 -> 7).
    - Changed all Quality++ Shiny qualities to have their level be ever so slightly better than their standard counterparts (from 21 -> q.level + 2).
    - Changed the odds for a Shiny event to occur from 1/1000 -> 1/2048.
    - Added all normal power adjustments that a quality would get (from other attributes not affected by level) to the Shiny quality counterparts.
    - All unique abilities remain intact for the specific quality level in question.
    - Rare: Shiny --- accumulator_capacity_multiplier: 1000 -> 125. This should be lower.
    - Rare: Mythical --- tool_durability_multiplier: 1000 -> 125. This should be lower.
    - ---
    - TODO: Find a way to dynamically adjust the Shiny Quality level as you unlock further and further qualities with something like the Milestones mod.
