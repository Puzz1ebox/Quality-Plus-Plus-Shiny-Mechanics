Version: 0.0.2
Date: 11JUL25
  Changes:
    - Executed a balance pass.
    - Changed all Standard Shiny qualities up to and including Legendary: Shiny to have its level set to 5 (from 21 -> 5).
    - Changed all Quality++ Shiny qualities to have their level be ever so slightly better than their standard counterparts (from 21 -> q.level + 2).
    - Changed the odds for a Shiny event to occur from 1/1000 -> 1/4096.
    - Added all normal power adjustments that a quality would get (from other attributes not affected by level) to the Shiny quality counterparts.
    - All unique abilities remain intact for the specific quality level in question.
    - Rare: Shiny --- accumulator_capacity_multiplier: 1000 -> 125. This should be lower.
    - Rare: Mythical --- tool_durability_multiplier: 1000 -> 125. This should be lower.
    - ---
    - TODO: Find a way to dynamically adjust the Shiny Quality level as you unlock further and further qualities with something like the Milestones mod.
